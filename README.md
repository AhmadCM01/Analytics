# Excel project
Dashboard for a bike selling company
This project contains a total of 4 worksheets, the raw data, the cleaned data sheet, the pivot sheet and the bike sales dashboard
The raw data is the initial list of bike buyers from the comapany, accumulated through customers reciepts, company's register etc.
The worksheet data contains the cleaned up data, I used formulas like Trim, Subsitute, XLookup to keep the data organized and aligned all data. I also added an additional column for Age bracket to keep the data organized and easily understood by any individual.
The Pivot sheet contains the sets of data organized for better visualization.
lastly, The dashboard sheet contains the visual representation of the average income, commute distance and Age brackets of customers generated income for the retail company. there's a slicer attached on the dashboard to make navigation easy for any individual interested in seeing the generated income for a particular category of the data. e.g Married individuals, Bachelors, Regions etc.
